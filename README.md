# Project-Management

## Microservices Architecture

## Overview
This project demonstrates a microservices architecture designed to manage different services such as Manager, Employee, and Project services. It leverages several core components to ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

### Core Components
- **Service Registry and Discovery (Eureka Server)**: Allows microservices to register themselves and discover other services.
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for all microservices.
- **Manager Service**: Handles operations related to managers.
- **Employee Service**: Manages employee-related operations.
- **Project Service**: Manages project-related operations.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all microservices, handling routing and load balancing.

### Microservices Enhancements
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity and correctness.
- **JUnit Testing**: Unit tests for verifying the functionality of the services.
- **Exception Handling**: Global exception handling for consistent error responses.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Modularizes cross-cutting concerns like logging and security.
